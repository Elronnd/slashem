* throw_obj(): null obj is passed to addinv_core2().  Presumably nullified by merged().

* Curses seems to sporadically enter a couple of infinite loops?  I had it happen once after enabling perm_invent where it refreshed forever taking up 100% cpu and then eventually segfaulted; that was probably stack overflow.  Another time it printed out 'Hello elronnd, welcome to SlashEM-Next!  You are a neutral female elven' a stupid number of times (took several seconds to finish).  (Possibly because it kept wanting to print out the second part of the message?)
* When you reduce the window size, curses wants to display its messages again and makes you <space> again
* Memory leaks in curses

* Wizmode-teleported on top of hole in castle, and got a segfault in hack.c:1858 (if ((mtmp = m_at(u.ux, u.uy)) && !u.uswallow)).  Debugger was useless and couldn't repro.

* Bad strength display in tcc.  Bad charisma display in pcc.  Bug in their vararg handling?

* Got accepted to the quest at xlvl10

* If you drink a potion that makes you weaker, such that total inv weight including that potion encumbers you, but weight without it doesn't, you're told 'Your movements are slowed slightly because of your load.  Your movements are now unencumbered.'

* impossible: dmonsfree: 0 removed doesn't match 1 pending

* "Hello, mc!  Welcome again to -Ball's weapons outlet!"

* " comes to live!"
 * (in grund's stronghold)

* Segfault w/tcc.  Can reproduce with bones file.  Stacktrace:
