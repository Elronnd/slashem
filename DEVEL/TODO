* Note: features intentionally not present from nethack:
 - Thrown potions have a chance to hit a steed's saddle.  I think this is a cool idea, but I think it's not worth having unless it can do more.
 - Elbereth changes.  There will more than likely be elbereth changes, but not those.
 - SAFERHANGUP (40b5b126739897ee9e0ba152fe08446b9c322589)
 - STATUS_VIA_WINDOWPORT (5ed547995d68bac551e9535e56c72b595167ceaf)
 - mimics not imitating statues in soko or boulders when over pits|holes (1fbd886068b790e73b65ed9f0d6a6558fff73ad1)
 - iron ball pit punishment changes
 - save selection menu
 - OPTIONS=role:!knight etc. (b064510a9be2bcb021e17d9ad90a49d9e9d1391e)
 - vampire dancing prevention (25a9c0ca4b74f0b9079caef954e99950286d75cd+5bc6f1444ea32f17d5ef74aff89307b4cc6e2ea9+7828cb368709ce7e49131d561720a805ed9e3999)

* Proper readline-style line editing (arrow-key movement, C-w/C-h (for curses); M-b, M-f, C-b, C-f, etc.)

* Star and fire vampires should be vampshifters, but need to come up with a good form for them to turn into.  (Maybe give vampire mages another alt form too?)  Star vampires can turn into a 'space kraken' (or a less cheesy name for the same concept)?
 - (polyself.c:348)

* Tutorial mode

* 'peaceful Mike's ghost' -> 'Mike's peaceful ghost' ?

* Health food shops should carry tins of spinach

* Polymorph messages for vampshifting

* Wish for (un)lock(ed|able) box.

* Wish for schroedinger's cat?  (It's always dead and 'you feel guilty'?)

* Add global warming.  It increases when you burn plastic.  It weakens and decreases spawn rate of fountain, pool, and watertrap; decreases ice melt timeout; makes spawned ice have a chance to be a fountain/pool instead; strengthens and increases spawn rate of lava and firetrap; decreases timeout for towel drying out
 - (fountains, pools, and watertraps don't just get generated less often, they evaporate as soon as they're generated, so you can 'hear a hissing noise' or w/e upon entering a level.  Same w/ice)
 - (Lava isn't straight-up generated more often; it's generated /slightly/ more often, but also: if lava is generated in a location, there's a good chance more will appear around it, which you can watch ('you hear a crumbling noise' or 'the ground gives way and more lava appears')

* More interesting stuff for health food store.  Also services.  Can they give you the ability to appraise food yourself for a while, cf a blessed ?oFood Detection?

* Encyclopedia: display text offset in _underscores_ as italic on supported terminals
* Use fuzzy matching for user-inputted encyclopedia entry checking?

* Release:
 - Update documentation
  * manpage
  * guidebook?
  * wiz command help
  * opthelp
  * windowport
 - Script?
 - Remove -Werror (silence all warnings?)
 - Cross-compile for all major platforms
 - Precompile lex/yacc-files (if applicable), remove irrelevant files (DEVEL/?), and tar into source release
 - Git tag?  Branch?
 - Save freeze

* Make rogue level only show up on rogue's birthday per https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commit/7b02e60db76d45c2c91bc7281d288e6b64182005#commitcomment-32053355, once dungeon switches to lua?

* Replace pretty much all uses of void* with anything.

* Investigate: would people be ok with no curses, but a rich sdl|gtk interface?  I kind of hate curses.  OTOH, public servers.  libtickit?  Termbox?
* SDL can't be very rich, gtk is stupid on windows.  Need to re-integrate nethackw?
* Bearlibterminal?

* Completely revamp interface:
 * More support for nhstr
  * Support attrs (bg, italic, inverse?, bold)
  * Allow to stuff tiles into an nhstr (so the ';' command can work sensibly w/tiles and the gamemap can be implemented in terms of putstr)
  * Message colours
 * Update proxy graphics.
 * win32, cocoa, gtk, android, ios windowports.  See README
 * web windowport?  https://github.com/coolwanglu/BrowserHack

* Integrate boehm gc?
 * Probably not
 * Re-evaluate once nhstr is pervasive

* Rewrite MAIL (actual email checking doesn't make sense, but there are a couple of other things that we might want):
 * Dgl mail
 * In-game chat system (integrate with #shout)
 * IRC notifications (write IRC plugin to make it log messages to a file and slashem pick them up)
  * Discord? (ugh)

* The ascension run: make it interesting.  No one likes the the WOY randomly appearing, and that only happens in order to make it more interesting than just "go up the stairs, rinse, repeat."  Also, the wizard appearing on the plane of earth cheapens him.  He should disappear after you perform the ritual and not come back.  Maybe make a group of high-level monsters appear every time you go up the stairs with the AOY?

* The castle: I like it.  Get rid of the wand of wishing and instead add more loot.  Some ideas: Currently, there are two barracks.  Instead of barracks, make each of those rooms contain 2/3 randomly of: barracks, unicorns, dragons.  Right now, there's a room of weapons, armour, food, and gems.  Gems are irrelevant, and food can be gotten elsewhere.  Replace it with 4/5 of: weapons, armour, scrolls, rings, and wands.
