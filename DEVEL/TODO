- json saves

- des/lev -> s7 scm (or lua, for 3.7 compat?)

- grammartree?

- Should deep dragons see through displacement?

- Portable build: uses embeddlb and puts save/xlog/perm/dump in dotdir, so single no-dependency binary

- Proper readline-style line editing (arrow-key movement, C-w/C-h (for curses); M-b, M-f, C-b, C-f, etc.)

- Star and fire vampires should be vampshifters, but need to come up with a good form for them to turn into.  (Maybe give vampire mages another alt form too?)  Star vampires can turn into a 'space kraken' (or a less cheesy name for something similar)?
  - (polyself.c:348)

- Tutorial mode (a la unnethack)

- 'peaceful Mike's ghost' -> 'Mike's peaceful ghost' ?

- Health food shops should carry tins of spinach

- Polymorph messages for vampshifting

- Wish for (un)lock(ed|able) box.

- Wish for schroedinger's cat?  (It's always dead and 'you feel guilty'?)

- Add global warming.  It increases when you burn plastic.  It weakens and decreases spawn rate of fountain, pool, and watertrap; decreases ice melt timeout; makes spawned ice have a chance to be a fountain/pool instead; strengthens and increases spawn rate of lava and firetrap; decreases timeout for towel drying out
  - (fountains, pools, and watertraps don't just get generated less often, they evaporate as soon as they're generated, so you can 'hear a hissing noise' or w/e upon entering a level.  Same w/ice)
  - (Lava isn't straight-up generated more often; it's generated /slightly/ more often, but also: if lava is generated in a location, there's a good chance more will appear around it, which you can watch ('you hear a crumbling noise' or 'the ground gives way and more lava appears')

- More interesting stuff for health food store.  Also services.  Can they give you the ability to appraise food yourself for a while, cf a blessed ?oFood Detection?

- Encyclopedia: display text offset in _underscores_ as italic on supported terminals
- Use fuzzy matching for user-inputted encyclopedia entry checking?
  - tre has approximate matching already, just need to hook it up

- Release:
  - Update documentation
    - manpage
    - guidebook?
    - wiz command help
    - opthelp
    - windowport
  - Script?
  - Remove -Werror (silence all warnings?)
  - Cross-compile for all major platforms
  - Precompile lex/yacc-files (if applicable), remove irrelevant files (DEVEL/?), and tar into source release
  - Git tag?  Branch?
  - Save freeze

- Make rogue level only show up on rogue's birthday per https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commit/7b02e60db76d45c2c91bc7281d288e6b64182005#commitcomment-32053355, once dungeon switches to lua?

- Replace most uses of void* with anything.

- Investigate: would people be ok with no curses, but a rich sdl|gtk interface?  I kind of hate curses.  OTOH, public servers.  libtickit?  Termbox?  Notcurses?
- SDL can't be very rich, gtk is stupid on windows.  Need to re-integrate nethackw?
- Bearlibterminal?

- Revamp interface interface:
  - More support for nhstr
    - Support attrs (bg, italic, inverse?, bold)
    - Allow to stuff tiles into an nhstr (so the ';' command can work sensibly w/tiles and the gamemap can be implemented in terms of putstr)
    - Message colours
  - Proxy graphics.
  - win32, cocoa, gtk, android, ios windowports.  See README
  - web windowport?  https://github.com/coolwanglu/BrowserHack

- Integrate boehm gc?
  - Probably not
  - Re-evaluate once nhstr is pervasive

- Rewrite MAIL (actual email checking doesn't make sense, but there are a couple of other things that we might want):
  - Dgl mail
  - In-game chat system (integrate with #shout)
  - IRC notifications (write IRC plugin to make it log messages to a file and slashem pick them up)
    - Discord? (ugh)
