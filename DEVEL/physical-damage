    Half_physical_damage 07

    It is not physical damage if:
    1. it already qualifies for some other special type of damage
       for which a special resistance already exists in the game
       including: cold, fire, shock, and acid. Note that fire is
       extended to include all forms of burning, even boiling water
       since that is already dealt with by fire resistance, and in
       most or all cases is caused by fire.
    2. it doesn't leave a mark. Marks include destruction of, or
       damage to, an internal organ (including the brain),
       lacerations, bruises, crushed body parts, bleeding.

    Current exceptions to the rule (already existing):
    - holy water burning chaotic ("it burns like acid") is physical damage.
    - unholy water burning lawful is physical damage.
