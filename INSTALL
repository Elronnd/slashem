To build Slash'EM9 on most unix-like systems, simply run 'make install' or 'gmake install'.
This will install to ~/slashem9install (where ~ is your home directory).
To make install somewhere else, add 'PREFIX' to your command line, as in 'make install PREFIX=~/.local'

You can then run ~/slashem9install/bin/slashem9 to play the game.
That script is relocatable, so feel free to move it somewhere else.
